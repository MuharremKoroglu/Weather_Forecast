## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This app is a weather forecast and shows how developers can use the API. I used <b>OpenWeather API</b> for weather conditions in this application. Thanks to the OpenWeather API, I have taken instant weather information and visuals describing the current temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions for the next five days. To get this information you need to install the <b>HTTP package</b>. After doing that, you need to import the 'HTTP' library. But don't forget to add the term <b>as http</b> to the 'HTTP' library. Next, we should use the <b>async</b> function to get the weather information. These functions need to be <b>Future</b> as they are asynchronous. In addition, we received the weather data from the API with the <b>'Uri.parse'</b> technique in the <b>'http.get'</b> method we use with await. We parsed this data with <b>'json.decode'</b>, turned it into meaningful data, took the information we wanted, and used it in the necessary parts of our application. We used many packages for the design of the application. The first of these is the <b>Google Fonts</b> package. Thanks to this package, we were able to easily use the font suitable for the application. The second package is the <b>SpinKit</b> package. With this package, we brought a different circular process indicator feature to our application. We used the <b>Font Awesome</b> package for humidity, pressure, and wind speed icons'. In addition, the warning message shown when the user typed city is not found on our search page was made using the <b>Awesome Dialog</b> package. Apart from that, the application starts the application by taking the location information of the user at the first startup. For this, the <b>Location</b> package has been added to the application. In addition to these, some <b>Card</b> widgets and <b>OverFlowBox</b> widgets were used to design the app. The section showing the weather information for the next 5 days has been included in a <b>ListView</b> widget and the scrolling feature has been gained. We used the <b>DateTime</b> class to display the current date information from the API in a way that the user can understand. In this way, the day names appearing on the screen are displayed in a way that the user is used to. Finally, we've made some improvements to the readability and reorganization of our code.<br><br>
